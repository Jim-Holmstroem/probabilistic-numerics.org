<h1>Probabilistic Numerics @ Data, Learning and Inference (DALI)</h1>
<h2>La Palma, Canary Islands, 10 - 12 April 2015</h2>

The first [DALI conference](http://isweb.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/dali/) will take
place from 10-12 April 2015 on [La Palma](http://www.visitlapalma.es), the
fiery [*Isla Bonita*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Palma) off the western
coast of Africa. DALI is a brand new outfit, aiming to provide an intimate
setting for researchers from the Learning communities to discuss recent and
ongoing research developments at length. We are thrilled to announce that the
inaugural instance of this promising new event will feature a session on
Probabilistic Numerics.

At this point we are in the process of contacting potential speakers, while
several details of the conference's schedule are finalized by the DALI
organizers. If you are interested in participating, please send a quick email
to [Philipp Hennig](mailto:phennig@tue.mpg.de). The conference is a nimble
outfit, unfortunately there is no funding for speakers' expenses.

The workshop is organized by Philipp Hennig, Michael Osborne, and Mark Girolami.  
(The chairs of DALI proper are Zoubin Ghahramani, Thomas Hofmann, Neil Lawrence
and Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf)
