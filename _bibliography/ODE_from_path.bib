  abstract =	 {Bayesian parameter estimation in coupled ordinary
                  differential equations (ODEs) is challenging due to the high
                  computational cost of numerical integration. In gradient
                  matching a separate data model is introduced with the
                  property that its gradient may be calculated
                  easily. Parameter estimation is then achieved by requiring
                  consistency between the gradients computed from the data
                  model and those specified by the ODE. We propose a Gaussian
                  process model that directly links state derivative
                  information with system observations, simplifying previous
                  approaches and improving estimation accuracy.}
