  abstract =	 {In the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations,
                  a function y(x) is to be reconstructed from knowledge of the
                  functional form of its derivative: dy/dx=f(x,y), together
                  with an appropriate boundary condition. The derivative f is
                  evaluated at a sequence of suitably chosen points (x_k,y_k),
                  from which the form of y(.) is estimated. This is an
                  inference problem, which can and perhaps should be treated by
                  Bayesian techniques. As always, the inference appears as a
                  probability distribution prob(y(.)), from which random
                  samples show the probabilistic reliability of the
                  results. Examples are given.}

                  both boundary and initial value problems that returns a joint
                  Gaussian process posterior over the solution. Such methods
                  have concrete value in the statistics on Riemannian
                  manifolds, where non-analytic ordinary differential equations
                  are involved in virtually all computations. The probabilistic
                  formulation permits marginalising the uncertainty of the
                  numerical solution such that statistics are less sensitive to
                  inaccuracies. This leads to new Riemannian algorithms for
                  mean value computations and principal geodesic
                  analysis. Marginalisation also means results can be less
                  precise than point estimates, enabling a noticeable speed-up
                  over the state of the art. Our approach is an argument for a
                  wider point that uncertainty caused by numerical calculations
                  should be tracked throughout the pipeline of machine learning
                  algorithms.},

  abstract =	 {This paper advocates expansion of the role of Bayesian
                  statistical inference when formally quantifying uncertainty
                  in computer models defined by systems of ordinary or partial
                  differential equations. We adopt the perspective that
                  implicitly defined infinite dimensional functions
                  representing model states are objects to be inferred
                  probabilistically. We develop a general methodology for the
                  probabilistic integration of differential equations via model
                  based updating of a joint prior measure on the space of
                  functions and their temporal and spatial derivatives. This
                  results in a posterior measure over functions reflecting how
                  well they satisfy the system of differential equations and
                  corresponding initial and boundary values. We show how this
                  posterior measure can be naturally incorporated within the
                  Kennedy and O'Hagan framework for uncertainty quantification
                  and provides a fully Bayesian approach to model
                  calibration. By taking this probabilistic viewpoint, the full
                  force of Bayesian inference can be exploited when seeking to
                  coherently quantify and propagate epistemic uncertainty in
                  computer models of complex natural and physical systems. A
                  broad variety of examples are provided to illustrate the
                  potential of this framework for characterising discretization
                  uncertainty, including initial value, delay, and boundary
                  value differential equations, as well as partial differential
                  equations. We also demonstrate our methodology on a large
                  scale system, by modeling discretization uncertainty in the
                  solution of the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid flow,
                  reduced to over 16,000 coupled and stiff ordinary
                  differential equations. Finally, we discuss the wide range of
                  open research themes that follow from the work presented.},

                  resolution and, as a consequence, connections cannot be found

                  contribute a Gaussian Process tractography algorithm which
                  allows for both quantification and visualization of its

                  visualization of individual tracts as well as in heat maps of
                  tract locations.  Finally, we provide a quantitative
                  evaluation of different metrics and algorithms showing that
                  the adjoint metric combined with our algorithm produces paths
                  which agree most often with experts.},

  abstract =	 {Runge-Kutta methods are the classic family of solvers for
                  ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and the basis for the
                  state-of-the art. Like most numerical methods, they return
                  point estimates. We construct a family of probabilistic
                  numerical methods that instead return a Gauss-Markov process
                  defining a probability distribution over the ODE solution. In
                  contrast to prior work, we construct this family such that
                  posterior means match the outputs of the Runge-Kutta family
                  exactly, thus inheriting their proven good
                  properties. Remaining degrees of freedom not identified by
                  the match to Runge-Kutta are chosen such that the posterior
                  probability measure fits the observed structure of the
                  ODE. Our results shed light on the structure of Runge-Kutta
                  solvers from a new direction, provide a richer, probabilistic
                  output, have low computational cost, and raise new research
