  abstract =	 {We consider the Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
                  (RMHMC) method for solving statistical inverse problems
                  governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The power
                  of the RMHMC method is that it exploits the geometric
                  structure induced by the PDE constraints of the underlying
                  inverse problem. Consequently, each RMHMC posterior sample is
                  almost independent from the others providing statistically
                  efficient Markov chain simulation. We reduce the cost of
                  forming the Fisher information matrix by using a low rank
                  approximation via a randomized singular value decomposition
                  technique. This is efficient since a small number of
                  Hessian-vector products are required. The Hessian-vector
                  product in turn requires only two extra PDE solves using the
                  adjoint technique. The results suggest RMHMC as a highly
                  efficient simulation scheme for sampling from PDE induced
                  posterior measures.},
