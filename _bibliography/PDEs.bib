  abstract =	 {We consider the Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
                  (RMHMC) method for solving statistical inverse problems
                  governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The power
                  of the RMHMC method is that it exploits the geometric
                  structure induced by the PDE constraints of the underlying
                  inverse problem. Consequently, each RMHMC posterior sample is
                  almost independent from the others providing statistically
                  efficient Markov chain simulation. We reduce the cost of
                  forming the Fisher information matrix by using a low rank
                  approximation via a randomized singular value decomposition
                  technique. This is efficient since a small number of
                  Hessian-vector products are required. The Hessian-vector
                  product in turn requires only two extra PDE solves using the
                  adjoint technique. The results suggest RMHMC as a highly
                  efficient simulation scheme for sampling from PDE induced
                  posterior measures.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a formal quantification of epistemic uncertainty induced by numerical solutions of ordinary and partial differential equation models. Numerical solutions of differential equations contain inherent uncertainties due to the finite dimensional approximation of an unknown and implicitly defined function. When statistically analysing models based on differential equations describing physical, or other naturally occurring, phenomena, it is therefore important to explicitly account for the uncertainty introduced by the numerical method. This enables objective determination of its importance relative to other uncertainties, such as those caused by data contaminated with noise or model error induced by missing physical or inadequate descriptors. To this end we show that a wide variety of existing solvers can be randomised, inducing a probability measure over the solutions of such differential equations. These measures exhibit contraction to a Dirac measure around the true unknown solution, where the rates of convergence are consistent with the underlying deterministic numerical method. Ordinary differential equations and elliptic partial differential equations are used to illustrate the approach to quantifying uncertainty in both the statistical analysis of the forward and inverse problems.},
