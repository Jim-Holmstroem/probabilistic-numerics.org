  abstract =	 {Bayesian quadrature treats the problem of numerical
                  integration as one of statistical inference. A prior Gaussian
                  process distribution is assumed for the integrand,
                  observations arise from evaluating the integrand at selected
                  points, and a posterior distribution is derived for the
                  integrand and the integral. Methods are developed for
                  quadrature in p. A particular application is integrating the
                  posterior density arising from some other Bayesian analysis.
                  Simulation results are presented, to show that the resulting
                  Bayes–Hermite quadrature rules may perform better than the
                  conventional Gauss–Hermite rules for this application. A key
                  result is derived for product designs, which makes Bayesian
                  quadrature practically useful for integrating in several
                  dimensions. Although the method does not at present provide a
                  solution to the more difficult problem of quadrature in high
                  dimensions, it does seem to offer real improvements over
                  existing methods in relatively low dimensions.}
