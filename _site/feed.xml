				<title>Tübingen Manifesto: Uncertainty</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We in Probabilistic Numerics face many unanswered questions in growing the field.
Our &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/22/Roundtable-2014-in-Tuebingen&quot;&gt;roundtable in Tübingen&lt;/a&gt; aimed to bring together our new community to begin to address some of these questions. 
This is the first of a sequence of posts that attempt to collate some of what we spoke about, and to, hopefully, provoke further discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first major question was: &lt;em&gt;what is a well-defined notion of “uncertainty” for a probabilistic numerical method?&lt;/em&gt; 
Consider &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\psi = \int_{0}^{1} \exp\bigl((\sin 3 x)^2 + x^2\bigr)\mathrm{d}x&lt;/script&gt;. 
In a sense, we know &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\psi&lt;/script&gt;: I was able to write it down using a small number of mathematical symbols.
However, of course, to find &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\psi&lt;/script&gt; to three significant figures, I, for one, would have to use a numerical algorithm (please let &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#115;&amp;#098;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#098;&amp;#111;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#120;&amp;#046;&amp;#097;&amp;#099;&amp;#046;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; know if you do actually have a closed form expression for &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\psi&lt;/script&gt;!). 
Given the finite precision of any numerical algorithm, can we really still be said to know &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\psi&lt;/script&gt;?
If not, how should we think about the uncertainty in &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\psi&lt;/script&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this, I think the roundtable arrived at a helpful consensus.
We came to the conclusion that uncertainty for probabilistic numerical algorithms was &lt;em&gt;exactly the same quantity&lt;/em&gt; that we are used to in statistics.
That is, a probabilistic numerical algorithm is doing exactly what we do in statistics: collecting data and estimating.
Specifically, a numerical integration algorithm, tasked with finding &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\psi&lt;/script&gt;, would collect evaluations of the integrand, and use them to estimate the integral.
For a probabilistic numerical integration algorithm, these evaluations will be used to inform a probabilistic model for the integrand, typically a Gaussian process, which can then be used to determine a posterior probability density for the integral.
As such, we can use exactly the notion of uncertainty we’re used to from any other form of statistical or probabilistic reasoning.
As with other probabilistic calculations, we could, if we desired, reframe the whole of probabilistic numerics as compression, using the language of coding theory. 
Whichever language we use, uncertainty in probabilistic numerics is clearly building on solid, existing, foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a caveat: the uncertainty returned by a probabilistic numerics algorithm is conditional on the prior information upon which it is constructed. 
Whether the returned uncertainty makes any sense will depend critically on the quality of the prior information included.
For example, in ODE solving, standard numerical algorithms typically ignore the uncertainty in past evaluations: final distributions will thus typically be unreasonably confident.
The output of numerical integration algorithms will likewise be 
reliant on the assumptions built into the inference for the probabilistic model for the integrand.
In constructing probabilistic numeric algorithms, we must be careful to ensure that our prior assumptions reflect, as best as possible, our true state of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More notes from the workshop to follow!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Roundtable in Tübingen</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers interested in probabilistic numerical methods gathered for a
two-day discussion forum on August 21-22 2014 at the Max Planck Institute for
Intelligent Systems in Tübingen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/roof.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable was organised by Philipp Hennig (MPI Tübingen) and Michael
Osborne (Oxford). Mark Girolami (UCL / Warwick) presented an invited talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable took place from the morning of 21 August to the early afternoon
of 22 August. Hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in
Tübingen, Germany, it provided an informal setting for everyone interested in
the development of probabilistic numerical methods. The roundtable was neither
a workshop nor a conference. There are no proceedings, and attendees did not
have to submit a paper to attend. Apart from a small number of talks, the
schedule focused strongly on small-group discussions on specific aspects. Some
of the questions discussed in 2014 included&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is a well-defined notion of “uncertainty” for a probabilistic numerical
method? What are the limits of error estimation?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are good data-structures for the communication between numerical methods
in a pipeline? How can numerical methods convey requirements for precision
among each other?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To which degree should numerical methods be inspired by existing numerical
frameworks, and where should we deviate from established concepts? Is there a
place for ab initio probabilistic solutions to existing numerical problems?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In building probabilistic methods, when are richer models worth their
associated computational cost? Can we develop families of numerical methods
with cost/accuracy trade-offs tunable to the requirements of the problem at
hand?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can we support new probabilistic numerical methods with the theory required
for them to find broad acceptance?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forming-a-community&quot;&gt;Forming a community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past years, a number of researchers stemming largely from the areas of
machine learning and statistics have attempted to build such probabilistic
numerical methods. A first meeting point for this group was the 2013 NIPS
Workshop on Probabilistic Numerics. Probabilistic Numerics is still a fledgling
community, in fact many of us do not know each other well, and we do not always
know of each other’s work. The Probabilistic Numerics Roundtable hopes to
alleviate this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
