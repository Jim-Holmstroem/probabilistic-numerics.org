Numerical algorithms, such as methods for the numerical solution of integrals
and ordinary differential equations, as well as optimization algorithms can be
interpreted as estimation algorithms [1,2]. They estimate the value of a
quantity that can not directly be derived (the value of an integral, the
solution of a differential equation, the location of an extremum), given the
values of quantities that can be directly observed (function values of the
integrand, evaluations of the differential equation, function values of the
gradient of an objective). So these methods inform inference, and are
accessible to the formal frameworks of probability theory. They are learning
machines.

Interpreting numerical methods as learning algorithms offers various
interesting benefits. It offers a joint framework for methods developed in
separate communities, thus allows transfer of knowledge among these areas. And
it can offer insight into the algebraic assumptions inherent in these methods
that may not be obvious from their standard formulation.

This website collects information pertaining to the development, analysis and
use of numerical algorithms with probabilistic interpretations. The links on
the left lead to sub-sites dealing with individual problem areas. Owing to the
differing nature and origin of these areas, their focus, theoretical direction,
application areas and lingo differ significantly. But they are linked by their
probabilistic approach.

This site originally arose from a workshop at Neural Information Processing
Systems 2012. The original website of this workshop can be found
