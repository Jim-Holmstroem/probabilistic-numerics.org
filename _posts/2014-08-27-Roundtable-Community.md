We in Probabilistic Numerics face many unanswered questions in growing the field.
Our roundtable in Tübingen aimed to bring together our new community to begin to address some of these questions. 
This is another of a sequence of posts that attempt to collate some of what we spoke about, and to, hopefully, provoke further discussion.

## Who are our users?

scientists care about: uncertainty emerges from the mathemcatical model alone
is our internal understanding of uncertainty necessary to communicate externally?

climate scientists understand that uncertainty is importnatn; the misfit between their models and data is large

active learning (digging wells) requires uncertainties from your algorithm

active learning is very important within numerics: refining grids
bounds are a guide, too loose in practice; properly calibrated measure is important

coherence is critical for numerical algorithms, and for scientists exploring a research hypothesis

the added output of uncertainty adds value for users to interrogate performance: enhanced profiler that provides details on the importance of every algorithm in your pipeline.  

Jes: rather than expecting users to come to us, we need to find an application, and embed ourselves in that application.

## Community

in probprg, it's taken almost a decade to achieve internal coherence, and still hasn't identified a single user group.

lessons from probprog: public presence and open tent; *don't want to over-sell, over*

computation is not such a problem any more, prob theory is more developed: the time is right for prob num

gecko: evolutionary community that has gone under the radar.

NIPS is too novelty driven
SIAM as a possible community to reach out to.
